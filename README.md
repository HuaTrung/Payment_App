## Introduction

You can find more examples in **[Size Limit: Make the Web lighter]** article.

Then, it adds your library as a dependency to the project and calculates
the real cost of your libraries, including all dependencies, webpack’s polyfills
for process, etc.


## Technology

- __[Spring boot](http://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) :__ makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run". We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.
